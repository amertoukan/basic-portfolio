<p id="about">Hello! My name is Amer, 
    I am completing my bachelor of commerce at Ryerson University. 
    While Completing my degree, I realized I enjoy coding and therefore, 
    I slowly started to teach myself the basics of coding. 
    I was able to understand the basics of html, css, and was also able to teach myself how to use parts of XCode! 
    To expand my knowledge, I decided to attend a bootcamp program at the University of Toronto to become a full stack developer. </p>
