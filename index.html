       <p>Hello! My name is Amer, 
                I am completing my bachelor of commerce at Ryerson University. 
                While Completing my degree, I realized I enjoy coding and therefore, 
                I slowly started to teach myself the basics of coding. 
                I was able to understand the basics of html, css, and was also able to teach myself how to use parts of XCode! 
                To expand my knowledge, I decided to attend a bootcamp program at the University of Toronto to become a full stack developer. </p>
